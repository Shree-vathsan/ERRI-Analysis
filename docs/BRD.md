**Author:** Vathsan
**Date:** August 21, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Business Problem
The e-commerce business currently lacks a centralized, data-driven system for monitoring customer health and revenue trends. Key decisions regarding marketing spend, customer engagement, and retention strategies are made with incomplete information. This leads to potential revenue loss from customer churn and inefficient allocation of marketing resources.

## 2. Project Goal & Objectives
The primary goal of the ERRI project is to build an end-to-end analytics solution to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, revenue patterns, and churn risk.

**Objectives:**
- **Track KPIs:** Develop a unified dashboard to monitor key performance indicators like Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Churn Rate.
- **Segment Customers:** Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify high-value, loyal, at-risk, and lost customers.
- **Measure Retention:** Analyze customer retention over time using cohort analysis to understand long-term user engagement.
- **Predict Churn:** Build a machine learning model to proactively identify customers who are at a high risk of churning.
- **Provide Recommendations:** Deliver data-backed strategies to improve customer retention and optimize marketing channel performance.

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope:**
- Data generation of a synthetic e-commerce dataset.
- Storage and management of data in a MongoDB Atlas database.
- Data analysis and modeling using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
- Creation of an interactive dashboard in Power BI / Tableau.
- Delivery of this BRD, a KPI Dictionary, and a final recommendations report.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Real-time data pipeline integration.
- A/B testing framework for marketing campaigns.
- Deployment of the churn model into a live production environment.

## 4. Key Stakeholders
- **Head of Marketing:** To use insights for targeted campaigns.
- **Head of Sales:** To monitor revenue trends and customer value.
- **Executive Leadership:** For a high-level overview of business health.

## 5. Deliverables

2. **Python Analysis Scripts:** Code for RFM, cohort, and churn analysis.
3. **Interactive Dashboard:** A multi-page Power BI/Tableau report.
4. **Business Documentation:** This BRD and a KPI Dictionary.
5. **Final Presentation:** A summary of findings and strategic recommendations.
